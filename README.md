# Sapienza WarBot - ready for war?
SapienzaWarBot is a war simulation between departments of Sapienza University of Rome.

Our website borns taking inspiration by his more famous "cousin" <a href="http://www.worldwarbot.com">worldwarbot.com</a>. Our version is just a bit improved to let people interact and decide who should win the war through a per-day vote system.

The battle lasted about 1 month and collected about 10k visits.
We didn't expect so much visits for a website that involves only students from Sapienza University.
Thanks for taking part of this.
